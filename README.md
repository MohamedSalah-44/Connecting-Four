# Connecting-Four
This project implements a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to play Connect Four using a custom environment created with OpenAI Gym and Kaggle Environments. The agent uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) for feature extraction and the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm from the Stable-Baselines3 library.
